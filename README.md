# 📊 Introduction to NumPy & Pandas  
### A Beginner-Friendly Guide for ColorStack Students  

This repository contains an introductory guide to data analysis using Python, focused on the fundamentals of:

- NumPy (Python numerical computing library)  
- pandas (Python data analysis library)  


---

## 🚀 Project Goal

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Build a strong foundation in numerical computing with NumPy  
- Learn how to manipulate and clean datasets using pandas  
- Practice handling real-world data problems (missing values, mixed types, etc.)  
- Prepare for data science, machine learning, and technical interviews  

This guide is beginner-friendly and designed for students who are just starting with data analysis.

# 🧠 What You’ll Learn

## 🔢 NumPy Fundamentals

- Creating arrays
- Vectorized operations
- Indexing and slicing
- Shape and dimensions
- Aggregation functions (`mean`, `sum`, `std`, `min`, `max`)
- Boolean masking

Why NumPy matters:
> It allows fast mathematical operations on large datasets.

## 🐼 Pandas Fundamentals

- Creating DataFrames
- Loading CSV files
- Inspecting data (`info()`, `head()`, `describe()`)
- Handling missing values
- Cleaning mixed data types
- Filtering and selecting data
- Basic data analysis

Why pandas matters:
> It allows structured data manipulation similar to working with spreadsheets, but with much more power.
